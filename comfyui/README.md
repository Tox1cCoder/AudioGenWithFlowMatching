# ComfyUI-TangoFlux
ComfyUI Custom Nodes for ["TangoFlux: Super Fast and Faithful Text to Audio Generation with Flow Matching"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21037). These nodes, adapted from [the official implementations](https://github.com/declare-lab/TangoFlux/), generates high-quality 44.1kHz audio up to 30 seconds using just a text promptproduction.

## Installation

1. Navigate to your ComfyUI's custom_nodes directory:
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
```

2. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/declare-lab/TangoFlux  ComfyUI-TangoFlux
```

3. Install requirements:
```bash
cd ComfyUI-TangoFlux/comfyui
python install.py
```

### Or Install via ComfyUI Manager

#### Check out some demos from [the official demo page](https://tangoflux.github.io/)

## Example Workflow

## Usage

**All the necessary models should be automatically downloaded when the TangoFluxLoader node is used for the first time.**

**Models can also be downloaded using the `install.py` script**

**Manual Download:**
- Download TangoFlux from [here](https://huggingface.co/declare-lab/TangoFlux/tree/main) into `models/tangoflux`
- Download text encoders from [here](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-large/tree/main) into `models/text_encoders/google-flan-t5-large`
  
*(Include Everything as shown in the screenshot above. Do Not Rename Anything)*

The nodes can be found in "TangoFlux" category as `TangoFluxLoader`, `TangoFluxSampler`, `TangoFluxVAEDecodeAndPlay`.
